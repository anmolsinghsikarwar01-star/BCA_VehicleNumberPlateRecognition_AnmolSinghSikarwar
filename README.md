# Major_Project
Developing a Real-Time Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System using image processing and machine learning techniques. 
# 🚗 Real-Time Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Real-Time Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System (ANPR)** that uses **Deep Learning (YOLO)** and **Computer Vision** to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images or video feeds.

The system automates vehicle identification, logs detected plate numbers with timestamps into a database, and provides a user-friendly dashboard interface for monitoring and analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect vehicle number plates using YOLO model
- Extract plate text using OCR
- Process uploaded video files
- Store results with timestamp in database
- Provide a simple dashboard interface

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 Upload video for detection
- 🔍 Automatic number plate detection
- 🧠 YOLO-based high accuracy detection
- 🔤 OCR-based text extraction
- 🗄 Automatic database logging
- 📊 Detection results display on dashboard
- ⚡ Fast and efficient processing
